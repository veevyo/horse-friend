a silly horse desktop buddy!

# known issues
- sometimes horsey gets stuck in a loop of going back and forth to the same location. temporary fix: restart the program
- tested it on a Windows machine and horsey doesn't appear on screen at all??? not sure if this is a recurring issue or just a one-off incident.
- has some funky compositing issues on openbox + compton. not program breaking but kinda ugly

# ideas for future releases
- let horsey be idle sometimes (random intervals)
- <s>randomize horsey's color at launch</s> <b>added as of <a href="https://github.com/veevyo/horse-friend/releases/tag/v1.1.0">v1.1.0</a></b>
